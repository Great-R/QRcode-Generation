# Personal Reflection on Data Encoding

## 1.Description

In this project, I was primarily responsible for implementing the core QR code encoding logic. This included string analysis, data encoding in different modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte), and generating the final bit stream. I also developed the module that structures the encoded data and error correction codewords into a final binary stream before matrix placement.

## 2.Feelings

Initially, I felt a bit overwhelmed by the complexity of the QR code specification. However, as I broke down the tasks into smaller components and tested them incrementally, I gained more confidence and satisfaction in seeing the encoding work correctly.

## 3.Evaluation

The encoding modules functioned correctly and aligned with the QR specification. The data was well-structured, and error correction codewords were integrated successfully. However, the Kanji mode was left unimplemented, and the analyse function only supported single-mode encoding, which limited flexibility.

## 4.Analysis

Developing this functionality improved my skills in binary operations and Python modular design. Key technical challenges included precise bit alignment and correct grouping of data. I also realized the importance of early validation when debugging interleaving logic for data and ECC codewords

## 5.Conclusions

Overall, my implementation contributed significantly to the projectâ€™s success. It showed that breaking down specifications and incremental development are effective strategies. However, the work remains incomplete without full mode support and deeper optimization strategies.

## 6.Action Plan

If I revisit this project, I plan to implement full Kanji mode support and extend the analyse function to allow mixed-mode encoding for better efficiency. I also intend to create a visualizer to display intermediate bit streams for easier debugging and understanding of the encoding process.
