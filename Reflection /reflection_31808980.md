1. **Description**

In our QR code project, I developed the ECC.py module to generate Reed-Solomon error correction codewords. I implemented the encode function to retrieve ECC length from a lookup table, used reedsolo for encoding, and extracted only the ECC portion from each data block. This ensured accurate and efficient error correction for robust QR code generation.

1. **Feelings**

Working on the core ECC module gave me a strong sense of ownership, while overcoming challenges with classmates made the teamwork and application of theory especially rewarding.

1. **Evaluation**

This project enhanced my understanding of error correction coding and teamwork, with my ECC module working well and smooth collaboration ensuring a successful outcome.

1. **Analysis**

The project succeeded through teamwork and modular design. I gained practical experience with Reed-Solomon coding using reedsolo, and learned the value of clear interfaces through work on data.py, constant.py, and ECC.py.

1. **Conclusions**

This project highlighted the value of applying classroom knowledge practically, boosting my skills and emphasizing teamwork’s role in success.

1. **Action Plan**

I plan to further study error correction algorithms and their use in areas like satellite communication and data storage. I’ll also improve my testing, documentation, and teamwork skills through more collaborative projects.
