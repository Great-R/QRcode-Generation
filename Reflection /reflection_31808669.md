# Personal Reflection on  Web Development

## 1.Description

I built a responsive web interface for the QR Code Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page allows users to input content and customize QR code appearance, including colors, shape, border, and filters. It also includes preview, download, and share functions.

## 2.Feelings

I was excited to design a real UI for user interaction. Seeing visual changes in real time was rewarding. At the same time, I was cautious about usability and layout consistency across screen sizes.

## 3.Evaluation

The layout is clean and mobile-friendly.
The use of <details> for customization keeps the form concise.
Real-time character counting and sliders improve user feedback.
However, some accessibility features (e.g. labels for screen readers) could be enhanced.

## 4.Analysis

This task helped me apply web development principles such as semantic HTML, responsive design, and form usability. Integrating dynamic feedback and styling via external CSS improved the interface quality.

## 5.Conclusions

General: Simplicity and clarity enhance user experience.
Specific: I should further improve accessibility and test edge cases on different devices.

## 6.Action Plan

Add ARIA labels for accessibility.
Implement validation feedback messages.
Test across browsers and screen sizes.
