# Group6 Reflection

## 1. Description
Our group project focused on developing a QR code generator website. The objective was to create a Python-based web application capable of generating functional QR codes, supporting multiple versions and incorporating Reed-Solomon error correction. The website needed to be interactive, intuitive, and maintainable.

## 2. Feelings
At the start, we were excited but also slightly overwhelmed by the technical and coordination challenges. As the project progressed, confidence grew due to effective teamwork and mutual encouragement. Completing the project brought a strong sense of accomplishment and pride in our collective effort.

## 3. Evaluation
The project was a highly valuable learning experience. Strengths included clear division of responsibilities, informal yet effective leadership, and supportive group dynamics. While we faced challenges—especially with code integration and style consistency—our collaborative approach helped us overcome them. The experience highlighted the importance of open communication, adaptability, and peer feedback.

## 4. Analysis
Using the “Big Five” teamwork framework by Salas et al. (2005), we identified key components of our teamwork:
- **Team Leadership**: Wang Wenbin stepped up informally as a leader, organizing tasks and motivating members.
- **Mutual Performance Monitoring**: We reviewed each other's work regularly, which contributed to a clear and thorough README.
- **Backup Behavior**: Team members stepped in during difficult coding tasks, such as resolving merge conflicts.
- **Adaptability**: We successfully adjusted to technical changes, like implementing Version 2 QR codes or switching masking patterns.
- **Team Orientation**: Our team consistently prioritized group goals over individual ones.

We also benefited from effective coordination mechanisms such as closed-loop communication, mutual trust, and shared mental models of the system architecture.

## 5. Conclusions
The project allowed us to gain not only technical skills in Python and web development but also soft skills like teamwork, communication, and conflict resolution. It showed that a well-coordinated team can overcome technical barriers and achieve meaningful outcomes.

## 6. Action Plan
For future projects:
- We'll establish consistent coding guidelines at the beginning to ease integration.
- We'll enhance documentation practices to maintain clarity.
- We plan to explore automated testing to reduce debugging effort.
- We will continue practicing the teamwork principles outlined by Salas et al. (2005) to improve our coordination and output quality.
